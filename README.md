# game_review_project
Video game recommendation engine based on metacritic reviews.

1) 'Games' folder holds the Spyder scraper for gathering the metacritic data.
2) 'Data' folder is where the raw data is saved. 'Clean Data' file is to process the data into tables and generate unique IDs for different data (games, users, publishers, etc.).
3) 'Neural Network - Recommendation Engine' uses the data to build a recommendation engine.

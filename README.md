# game_review_project
This project's goal is to build a recommendation system from scratch, including collecting the data, preparing it, building a model, and deploying an interactive app.

1) 'Games' folder holds the Spyder scraper for gathering the metacritic data.
2) 'Data' folder is where the raw data is saved. 'Clean Data' file is to process the data into tables and generate unique IDs for different data (games, users, publishers, etc.).
3) 'Neural Network - Recommendation Engine' uses the data to build a recommendation engine.
4) 'app' folder holds the code for the web application.

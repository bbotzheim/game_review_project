Fun and accessible, it takes a simple arcade-like approach to the genre of real-time strategy. The player controls the Red Army as it defends Earth from the Martian Invasion of 1942, the highly classified military operation which even today remains a closely guarded state secret. Stalin himself conducts the mission briefings, and later even becomes a playable unit. The bold leader is duly serious even as he faces the most ridiculous threat the world has ever known. The game itself is far from standard RTS fare; this is not a realistic and deeply strategic war simulation, but a straightforward, fun and light-hearted arcade-style game complete with power-ups falling from conquered foes in the form of bright shiny coins.

The world changed radically, with all the planet’s monsters disappearing in an instant, leaving behind only jewels that radiated tremendous energy. This energy source became known as jewel power and enabled the survivors to revive their civilization. Now, the peace achieved through jewel power has been endangered by a new threat. Strange Abominations have mysteriously appeared and unleashed legions of monsters on the helpless populace.

In addition to the feature-loaded multiplayer experience, gamers of all skill levels can mix it up in two heart-pounding single-player or co-operative campaigns where  players assume the role of a Delta Force operator sent to Asia to bring a drug cartel and former Soviet mercenaries to justice. The NovaWorld Community allows every element of the gameplay, from the enhanced ballistics to the innovative in-vehicle spawn system, to be carefully coordinated to support a fully balanced experience where teamwork is deadlier than individual firepower, and in DFX2, intelligence and creativity are rewarded as much as fast-twitch reflexes. The game also ships with a powerful MED level editor, which will allow gamers full utilization of game assets to create their own levels, including additional multiplayer game types.

This includes the unique 'Team Battle' mode, which doesn't utilize the traditional first, second and third place finishes. Players win the race by depleting their rival's Spirit Points, which are decreased by contact with walls, cars and by falling behind other racers.

By earning points for each victory, players can judge how they stack up against their rivals and cherry-pick their competition from the player roster as they look to seize territories. Win and increase team loyalty, recruit defeated riders and increase your supremacy on the streets while being upgraded in the rankings. But lose, and learn quickly that there are no points for second place in street racing.

However, with the first few volunteers it became clear that something has gone wrong: after ten days the rejuvenation was so intense that a body couldn?t take that much of a shock. All of the subjects died of a stroke. In 1936 Japan and Germany sign the Anti-Comitern Pact. Hitler?s leading scientist Josef Mengele negotiated the terms of the cooperation with Japanese concerning the research of the regenerative substance. These negotiations lasted until 1941, when Germans realized that their soldiers aren?t able to bare the cold Russian climate. Japanese, concerned for their interests in Russia, decided to help them unconditionally. In December, 1941 the Institute for Hereditary Biology with its leading scientist dr. Mengele received a mysterious package from Japan. Only the chosen ones knew that it contained all records regarding the creation of the regenerative substance. To get to Germany as soon as possible, pilots of the cargo plane had to fly over the enraging Stalingrad front.

JU-ON: The Grudge for Wii is a Haunted House Simulator where accessibility and instant scares are given priority over all other game aspects, with the original creator of the movie, Takashi Shimizu, serving as a creative consultant to game development. It is said that when a person dies with a deep and burning grudge, a curse is born. When an average housewife in Nerima, Japan, was murdered in a grisly fashion, it gave rise to a curse so powerful that it threatens to kill at a pace thought unimaginable before. The curse manifests on those who encounter the curse by any means, such as entering the house or being in contact with somebody who was already cursed. Once Erika Yamada is exposed to the curse while searching for her dog in an abandoned warehouse, the entire Yamada family is put in grave danger as soon as she reunites with them at home. They must now face their individual challenges alone, and only by overcoming the curse together will their family truly be free again. Using the Wii Remote as a flashlight, JU-ON: The Grudge has players move forward with the touch of a button and explore haunted areas such as an abandoned warehouse, a dimly-lit hospital, and a mannequin factory. Much like a haunted house, the player must proceed forward even after being frightened and running away from the initial threat. As much fun as it is to get scared, sometimes it’s even more fun to watch others play to observe their reactions. For instant gratification, grab a second Wii Remote and push buttons to make in-game events happen immediately to make the player jump and hate you forever.

The king, a wise ruler with keen insight on keeping his subjects happy, decided that these fighters should do battle not in dingy back alleys and rat infested warehouses like they were used to, but rather they should be able to showcase their aptitude in an officially sanctioned environment. And so the great Arena was built, and the official Coliseum League was birthed. The sport soon became massively popular. From thousands of leagues away, from every walk of life, the citizenry of the kingdom came to witness the carnage in the arena and cheer on their favorite gladiators. And as in any organized professional sport, there were those that managed the teams of warriors. In a sport where the loser is carted off to feed the crows being a manager is no easy task. Warriors must be carefully groomed for battle. Training is an always ongoing process, and when training doesn't seem to be providing the edge managers may turn to dark sorceries and alchemy. In the end, all of this may be for naught, as old age is still the ultimate leveler of man... In Stormcloud Creations' Coliseum players will get the chance to become those managers.

Never-before-seen gameplay elements create the first true-to-life police action game, and moments taken directly from the series immerse players in the disturbing Farmington underworld now recognized by millions as Vic Mackey's universe. Players control Vic in a living, breathing Farmington, engaging in perilous assignments ranging from busting crack dens to thwarting bank robberies. Much like the series, Vic and the Strike Team delve into the grayest areas of the law, fighting a war on crime where the ends justify the means. In addition to the raw action that undergirds the gameplay, players employ tactics used by Vic on the show, including intimidating suspects, employing brute force, accepting and offering bribes and planting incriminating evidence. The game also lets players choose between the right and wrong side of the law, with Vic walking a thin line while trying to accomplish missions, maintain the respect of his men, keep his politically ambitious police captain happy, pad his retirement fund and, above all, avoid Internal Affairs.

The objective of the source material is to reach the top of each level, taking out any enemies in the way by firing magical rainbows that can trap or eliminate foes as well as providing bridges for the player to walk on. Rainbows remain onscreen for a short amount of time but can be ?broken? by the player if they jump on them. Once broken, the rainbow will fall off the screen, taking out the first enemy it touches. The game also features a pleasing bonus item system where dispatched enemies leave behind items of food that have varying point values and power-ups that have a range of helpful effects. The major feature of this re-interpretation is shifting the entire game away from traditional controls by implementing a global touchscreen control system which radically alters the way in which the game plays. The game is also displayed across both screens of the DS. Rather than being fired by a button press, rainbows are now drawn directly onto the gameplay area using the stylus and movement is executed by dragging the player?s character around the levels. The objective is still to reach the top of the level, but the time limit has been extended to account for the player being unable to move and use rainbows simultaneously.

Players can choose from five distinct character classes and customize them with hundreds of weapons, armor and items, equipping the right gear for each intense encounter.  Unlike other action RPGs, in Mage Knight Apocalypse, players have no need to worry about ability points or discreet levels to gain.  Instead, character development depends on what type of playing style the player enjoys.  Swinging a heavy sword makes you stronger, casting spells makes your magic more powerful, and shooting bows improve dexterity.  The skills players use and the way they use them determines how the character develops. [Namco]",Mage Knight: Apocalypse,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/mage-knight-apocalypse

The Union fleet blockaded the Southern ports, rupturing all the trading connections of the Confederacy. In return, Confederate government started giving out the privateer patents, thus building a powerful fleet of commercial raiders, the best example of which was the legendary captain Raphael Semmes. Also, smuggling the goods through the blockade became very profitable, though risky, business and attracted numerous traders to attempts of running the blockade. Abraham Gray, the main character, starts the game as a captain of a privately-owned vessel, but soon becomes involved into the story of blockade-running, military espionage and the ultimately powerful ironclad, built in Liverpool for the Confederacy. This ironclad alone could have change the course of war and bring the victory to the Rebel states. Then Abraham can join either Confederacy as a raider, or a Union as a spy. The player is free to sail across the game’s world – from southern coasts of the USA and Florida to Jamaica and North Caribbean. He can trade and smuggle goods between nineteen ports – both free and blockaded, raid the cargo ships, battle the warships and ironclads and complete quests for either Union or Confederacy. Aside from naval combat, Swashbucklers features strong on-foot gameplay, in which Abraham slashes his way through in various locations, confronting dozens of various enemies and bosses. The game’s role-playing system, based of three main characteristics and numerous perks, allows the player to develop the main character in various ways. He can improve his naval skills, learn new combos and shooting modes, or become the best trader in the Caribbean.
